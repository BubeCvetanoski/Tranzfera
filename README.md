Tranzfera is Native Android application developed with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It serves the purpose of Bluetooth and it leverages its functionalities via user interface. 
Thus you can track the state of the bluetooth, turn it on, scan for devices and stop the scanning. Also you can see the paired devices as well as pair scanned device with a simple click. You can also connect on some of the paired devices, so the app is working as a server and a client within the bluetooth connection. The media transfer is yet to be implemented.
