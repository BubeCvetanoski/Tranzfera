Tranzfera is Native Android application developed with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It servers the purpose of Bluetooth and it leverages its functionalities via user interface. 
Thus you can track the state of the bluetooth, turn it on, scan for devices and stop the scanning. Also you can see the paired devices as well as pair scanned device with a simple click. The connection between paired devices and media transfer is 
yet to be implemented. Also the code looks messy right now without any architecture introduced, because the functionality is what matters at this stage.
